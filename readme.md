## Aims

Started 24/12/2024

Learn about lattice encryption, learning with errors and implement it from scratch in pure python. Try to do a toy implemenation that is resistance to quantum computing. 

Based on notes:

https://courses.grainger.illinois.edu/cs598dk/fa2019/Files/lecture10.pdf


Those notes were too basic. and doesn't really cover the link between a lattice and LWE. That was cast as a classroom example using a linear system. 

This paper covers using rings and LWE for a lattice hard probelm:

### Structure

Maybe make this a package

Use pytests
